Hox genes are highly conserved, master regulators of spatial patterning in the embryo, but how these factors trigger regional morphogenesis has largely remained a mystery. In the developing gut, Hox genes help demarcate identities of the small and large intestines early in embryogenesis, which ultimately leads to their specialization in both form and function. While the midgut forms villi, the hindgut develops flat, brain-like sulci that resolve into heterogeneous outgrowths. Combining mechanical measurements and mathematical modeling, we demonstrate that the posterior Hox gene Hoxd13 regulates biophysical phenomena that shape the hindgut lumen. We further show that Hoxd13 acts through the TGFβ pathway to thicken, stiffen, and promote isotropic growth of the subepithelial mesenchyme; together, these features lead to hindgut surface buckling. TGFβ, in turn, promotes collagen deposition to affect mesenchymal geometry and growth. We thus identify a cascade of events downstream of positional genetic identity that direct posterior intestinal morphogenesis.
